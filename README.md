# Star Words Game

A phrase guessing game that allows the user to add several phrases to the Game constructor that others may play.

After starting, a new Game object is created, as well as the Phrase object holding the randomly chosen phrase.

Players my either click letter on the screen keyboard or press keys on their physical keyboard.

The application will check to see if their letter is in the phrase selected.

If the player guesses the phrase, they are taken to a win screen. Alternatively, after selecting five incorrect letters, the player is taken to a lose screen.

The player may then restart the game and try again.

I themed the game after Star Wars and initially provide popular phrases from several of their films.
